## ✅ **What's New (Implemented)**

*   **AI Prop & Staging Assistant (Product Mode):** The AI now acts as your creative partner. A new "Suggest Props" button analyzes your product and provides a list of relevant, clickable prop ideas to instantly stage your scene.
*   **Advanced Material Engine (Product Mode):** A new "Material & Reflections" control allows you to specify your product's surface material (e.g., Matte, Glossy, Metallic, Glass), giving the AI critical information to render light and reflections with a dramatic increase in photorealism.
*   **Dynamic Environmental Effects (Apparel & Product Modes):** A new "Environmental Effects" input has been added to the Scene settings, allowing you to describe atmospheric details like "a gentle breeze," "light drizzle," or "thick fog" for more dynamic and professional visuals.

## 1. AI-Powered Automation & Intelligence
*Making the AI a proactive creative partner, not just a tool.*

### ➤ ✅ AI Prop & Staging Assistant
- **Problem:** Thinking of and describing relevant props to stage a product requires creative energy and time.
- **Solution:** An AI suggestion engine. Based on the uploaded product, the AI will recommend a list of contextually relevant props (e.g., "spilled coffee beans" for a coffee bag; "a marble cube" for a watch). Users can add these to the scene with a single click.
- **Benefit:** Speeds up the creative process, provides inspiration, and makes it easy to create richer, more professional scenes.

### ➤ Batch Processing & Scene Templating ("The Easel")
- **Problem:** E-commerce brands need to shoot dozens of products with the exact same lighting, angle, and background for catalog consistency. Setting this up manually for each item is extremely time-consuming.
- **Solution:** A "Save Scene" feature that captures the entire studio setup (lighting, camera, surface, props, etc.) as a reusable template. Users can then enter a "Batch Mode," upload multiple products or models, apply a saved template, and generate all variations in one go.
- **Benefit:** A massive reduction in manual work, ensuring perfect brand consistency across an entire product line or campaign. This is a game-changer for high-volume sellers.

### ➤ Natural Language Controls
- **Problem:** Clients and marketers often don't know technical photography terms like "f/1.8 aperture" but know they want a "blurry background."
- **Solution:** An optional text input where users can type simple commands like *"Make the lighting more dramatic,"* or *"Shoot it from a low angle to look heroic."* The AI translates these into the appropriate slider and option adjustments.
- **Benefit:** Makes advanced creative controls accessible to everyone, regardless of their photography knowledge.

### ➤ Interactive AI Art Director (Chat-based)
- **Problem:** The current Art Director provides great starting points, but iteration requires manual tweaking.
- **Solution:** Evolve the Art Director into a chat assistant. After applying a concept, a user could type follow-up commands like, *"That's great, but make it feel more vintage,"* or *"Now show me a version on a city street."*
- **Benefit:** Creates a fluid, conversational workflow that makes iterating and exploring creative ideas faster and more intuitive.

## 2. Enhanced Realism & Staging Capabilities
*Creating more dynamic, believable, and high-end visuals.*

### ➤ ✅ Advanced Material & Reflection Engine
- **Problem:** Different materials (e.g., metal, glass, fabric) react to light in unique ways. Photographing reflective products is a real-world nightmare.
- **Solution:** A "Product Material" dropdown with options like `Matte`, `Glossy`, `Metallic`, `Glass`. This gives the AI critical information on how to render light and reflections. Add a "Reflection Control" setting with options like `Studio Softbox (Clean Highlights)` or `Environmental`.
- **Benefit:** A dramatic increase in photorealism, especially for challenging products like jewelry, chrome, and glassware.

### ➤ ✅ Dynamic Environmental Effects
- **Problem:** Scenes can sometimes feel static and sterile.
- **Solution:** A new "Effects" panel to add generative elements that interact with the product and environment. Examples include:
    - **Liquids:** `Water Splashes`, `Coffee Drips`, `Creamy Swirls`.
    - **Atmospherics:** `Gentle Smoke`, `Hot Steam`, `Floating Dust Motes`.
    - **Textures:** `Scattered Flour`, `Powder Dusting`, `Crushed Ice`.
- **Benefit:** Allows for the creation of dynamic, high-impact commercial and editorial images that would be complex and expensive to shoot physically.

### ➤ Product Grouping & Packaging Mode
- **Problem:** Products are often sold and shot with their packaging or as part of a collection.
- **Solution:** Allow users to upload a primary product and a secondary "Packaging" or "Companion Product" image. The AI would then intelligently stage the items together in an artistic composition.
- **Benefit:** Enables the creation of "hero" shots, marketing assets, and bundle images directly within the platform.

## 3. Streamlined Workflow & Multi-Format Output
*Focusing on getting all the required assets, fast.*

### ➤ Automated Asset Packs (Multi-Platform Delivery)
- **Problem:** A brand needs multiple versions of an image for different platforms: a clean catalog shot for their website, a lifestyle shot for Instagram, a vertical version for Stories, etc.
- **Solution:** A "Generate Pack" option. The user sets up one "hero" look, and the AI automatically generates a complete set of useful variations in one click (e.g., main shot, isolated on white, 1:1 crop, 9:16 crop).
- **Benefit:** Radically streamlines the content delivery pipeline, saving hours of manual cropping and editing.

### ➤ Smart Wardrobe (AI-Assisted Layering & Description)
- **Problem:** Users have to manually categorize apparel and figure out the correct layering order.
- **Solution:** The AI automatically suggests an `ApparelCategory` on upload. If a user uploads an 'Outerwear' item after a 'Top', the system can suggest the correct layering order. The AI could also pre-populate the description field with a basic analysis (e.g., "Short-sleeve cotton t-shirt").
- **Benefit:** Reduces manual input and potential for user error, making the setup process faster and more intelligent.

## 4. Future Vision: Business Intelligence & Growth Tools
*Connecting creative production to business outcomes.*

### ➤ Visual Consistency Engine ("Brand Profile")
- **Concept:** Allow a brand to upload their mood board or existing campaign photos. The AI will analyze these to create a unique **"Brand Profile,"** extracting dominant color palettes, lighting styles, and overall aesthetics. A simple toggle, **"Apply Brand Profile,"** would then guide all generations to conform to the brand's established visual identity.

### ➤ Visual A/B Testing Integration
- **Concept:** Generate multiple visual variations (e.g., different model, pose, or background) for a single product. Natively integrate with e-commerce platforms to deploy these variations and track which image results in a higher conversion rate.

### ➤ Direct E-commerce Sync
- **Concept:** Native integrations with platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce. Push generated images, videos, and AI-generated product descriptions directly to product listings with a single click.
